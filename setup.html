    <h2>Choosing the Right Tank</h2>
    <p>
      For beginners, a 10–20 gallon glass or acrylic tank is ideal. It is big enough to keep the
      water stable, but small enough to fit in most apartments or bedrooms.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a sturdy surface that can support the full weight of the tank.</li>
      <li>Avoid placing the tank in direct sunlight to reduce algae and temperature swings.</li>
      <li>Plan access to a power outlet and a sink or bucket for water changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Essential Equipment</h2>
    <p>Your basic freshwater setup should include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A filter rated for your tank size or slightly larger.</li>
      <li>A heater with an adjustable thermostat (for tropical fish).</li>
      <li>A thermometer so you can actually monitor the temperature.</li>
      <li>A water conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine from tap water.</li>
      <li>A liquid test kit for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Understanding the Nitrogen Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      The nitrogen cycle is the process where beneficial bacteria convert toxic ammonia from fish
      waste into less harmful nitrate. Cycling the tank means building up those bacteria before
      adding a full group of fish.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up the tank with substrate, filter, and heater. Add dechlorinated water.</li>
      <li>Provide a source of ammonia (fish food, bottled ammonia, or a hardy starter fish).</li>
      <li>Test the water every few days for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate.</li>
      <li>
        Wait until ammonia and nitrite both drop to 0 ppm and nitrate is present before slowly
        adding more fish.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Cycling can take several weeks, but it prevents burned gills, stress, and early fish deaths.
